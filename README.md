## Previous Task #1

**Your task is to:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Create your "day of Christmas" in the days folder (which day is in the Discord channel)
3. Create a branch on GitHub and push there
4. Create a pull request for your branch
- Please name files and branches with `dayxx` (e.g. `day01`, `day10`)
- You need both a `dayxx.cpp` and `dayxx.h`
- Be certain you are pushing to your branch, not origin. If you're unsure, test it out first in your own repository
- Make sure your line of Christmas sends a message on the right days, and include `\n` at the end of the return string
- If it is not your day of Christmas, return `""`
- Use `intro_line.cpp` and `intro_line.h` as examples
- Follow the format of the 12 Days of Christmas song, you may make a parody of the line if you want
- Do NOT push, especially force push, make a pull request
